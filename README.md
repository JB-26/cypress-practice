Just practicing Cypress!

The JS file included performs a series of tests across three different viewports:
- Desktop
- Tablet
- Mobile

The names of the viewports are stored in an array, which then uses the forEach method on each size.

The tests look at the Cypress Kitchen Sink (as I want to make sure I'm using a site that allows automated scripts to view it - I don't want to cause any trouble!)

The tests do a variety of actions such as entering text, submitting forms, clearing text and more!
